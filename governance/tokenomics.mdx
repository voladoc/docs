## Token Utility

<Card>
  VOLA is designed with multiple utility functions that create sustainable value capture.
</Card>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Governance">
    <div className="mb-4">
      VOLA holders can lock their tokens to receive veVOLA (vote-escrowed VOLA), providing governance rights:
    </div>
    
    - Vote on protocol parameters and upgrades
    - Propose governance actions
    - Determine protocol fee distributions
    - Guide protocol development priorities
    - Approve strategic integrations
    
    <Note>
      Governance power scales with both the amount of VOLA locked and the lock duration, with maximum power achieved at a 4-year lock.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Economic Benefits">
    <div className="mb-4">
      VOLA tokens provide holders with multiple economic benefits:
    </div>
    
    - Share of protocol revenue through fee distribution
    - Boosted rewards across protocol products
    - Fee discounts on protocol operations
    - Access to exclusive VOLA-gated features
    - Participation in special ecosystem opportunities
    
    <Warning>
      The value of these benefits correlates with protocol adoption and usage, creating a positive feedback loop between protocol success and token value.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="System Integrity">
    <div className="mb-4">
      VOLA plays a critical role in maintaining system integrity:
    </div>
    
    - Incentivizes actions that benefit system health
    - Attracts stakeholders committed to long-term success
    - Distributes governance to motivated participants
    - Creates economic alignment among ecosystem participants
    - Rewards behavior that increases protocol security
    
    <Note>
      This utility function ensures that protocol participants have "skin in the game" and are incentivized to act in the best interest of the ecosystem.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Token Allocation

<Card>
  The total VOLA supply of 100,000,000 tokens is allocated across several key stakeholder groups.
</Card>

<Frame>
  ![VOLA Token Allocation](/images/vola-allocation.png)
</Frame>

| Allocation Category | Percentage | Amount | Purpose |
| :------------------ | :--------- | :----- | :------ |
| **Community Treasury** | 25% | 25,000,000 | Funding ongoing development, grants, and ecosystem growth |
| **User Incentives** | 30% | 30,000,000 | Rewards for protocol participants and liquidity providers |
| **Team & Advisors** | 20% | 20,000,000 | Compensating core team and key advisors |
| **Initial Investors** | 15% | 15,000,000 | Seed and private funding rounds |
| **Strategic Partners** | 5% | 5,000,000 | Key ecosystem and integration partnerships |
| **Public Sale** | 5% | 5,000,000 | Community participation and initial distribution |

## Emission Schedule

<Card>
  VOLA follows a carefully designed emission schedule to ensure sustainable distribution over time.
</Card>

<Columns>
  <Column>
    ### Launch Distribution
    
    At protocol launch, approximately 20% of the total supply is unlocked:
    
    - Public sale participants: 5% fully unlocked
    - Team & advisors: 5% initial unlock
    - Initial investors: 3% initial unlock
    - Community treasury: 5% initial unlock
    - Strategic partners: 2% initial unlock
  </Column>
  
  <Column>
    ### Ongoing Emissions
    
    The remaining 80% is emitted over 4 years:
    
    - User incentives: Linear release over 4 years
    - Team & advisors: 3-year vesting with 1-year cliff
    - Initial investors: 2-year vesting with 6-month cliff
    - Community treasury: 4-year linear release
    - Strategic partners: 2-year linear release
  </Column>
</Columns>

<Frame>
  ![Emission Schedule](/images/vola-emission-schedule.png)
</Frame>

<Note>
  This gradual emission schedule ensures that token distribution aligns with protocol growth and adoption, preventing market oversupply while supporting necessary incentives.
</Note>

## veVOLA Mechanism

<Card>
  The vote-escrowed VOLA (veVOLA) system is central to the token's governance and reward mechanisms.
</Card>

### veVOLA Basics

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locking Mechanism">
    Users can lock their VOLA tokens for periods ranging from 1 week to 4 years.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Voting Power">
    veVOLA voting power scales with both the amount locked and the lock duration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reward Boosting">
    veVOLA holders receive boosted rewards across protocol products (up to 2.5x).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fee Sharing">
    veVOLA holders receive a share of protocol fees proportional to their veVOLA balance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### veVOLA Formula

<Card>
  **Voting Power and Reward Boost Calculation:**
  
  The amount of veVOLA received for locking VOLA is calculated as:
  
  ```
  veVOLA = VOLA amount ร (lock duration in weeks รท 208 weeks)
  ```
  
  Where 208 weeks represents the maximum 4-year lock period.
  
  For example:
  - 1,000 VOLA locked for 1 year (52 weeks) = 250 veVOLA
  - 1,000 VOLA locked for 4 years (208 weeks) = 1,000 veVOLA
</Card>

<Warning>
  Once VOLA is locked, it cannot be unlocked before the end of the chosen lock period. This mechanism encourages long-term alignment with the protocol's success.
</Warning>

## Fee Distribution

<Card>
  Protocol fees from both the Wave Protocol and hbHYPE liquid staking are distributed according to the following model:
</Card>

<Frame>
  ![Fee Distribution Model](/images/fee-distribution.png)
</Frame>

<Columns>
  <Column>
    ### Fee Sources
    
    - Wave Protocol minting fees
    - Wave Protocol redemption fees
    - Wave Protocol flash loan fees
    - hbHYPE liquid staking rewards fee
    - Integration partnership fees
    - Other ecosystem product fees
  </Column>
  
  <Column>
    ### Distribution Channels
    
    - veVOLA holders (30%)
    - Rebalancing Pool (50%)
    - Protocol Treasury (15%)
    - Insurance Fund (5%)
  </Column>
</Columns>

<Note>
  This distribution model ensures that protocol revenue flows to both token holders (creating value accrual) and to critical protocol functions that maintain system health.
</Note>

## Incentive Design

<Card>
  The VOLA tokenomics model incorporates several mechanisms designed to create sustainable, aligned incentives.
</Card>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Liquidity Mining">
    <div className="mb-4">
      Strategic VOLA emissions to liquidity providers follow a dynamic model:
    </div>
    
    - Initial high emissions to bootstrap liquidity
    - Gradual reduction to sustainable levels
    - Concentration in strategic pools
    - veVOLA boosting to reward loyal users
    - Performance-based adjustments
    
    <Warning>
      Unlike many failed liquidity mining programs, VOLA's model includes critical anti-mercenary protections and sustainability mechanisms.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Gauge System">
    <div className="mb-4">
      VOLA implements a gauge voting system for incentive direction:
    </div>
    
    - veVOLA holders vote on where incentives should flow
    - Biweekly epochs for gauge weight adjustments
    - Dynamic reward allocation based on votes
    - Gauge options include protocol products and partner integrations
    - Strategic options to maximize protocol growth
    
    <Note>
      This system ensures that incentives are directed where the community believes they will have the greatest impact on protocol success.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Protocol Health">
    <div className="mb-4">
      Special incentives target actions that improve system security and health:
    </div>
    
    - Enhanced rewards for Rebalancing Pool participation
    - Targeted emissions during specific system states
    - Incentives for product utilization equilibrium
    - Rewards for early participation in new products
    - Bonuses for protocol referrals and growth actions
    
    <Note>
      These incentives ensure that participants are rewarded for actions that contribute to protocol sustainability and security.
    </Note>
