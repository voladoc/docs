# Governance

VOLA Protocol implements a sophisticated ve3,3 governance model, combining Curve Finance's vote-escrowed (ve) mechanism with OlympusDAO's (3,3) game theory model. This hybrid approach aligns the interests of all protocol participants, ensures long-term sustainability, and enhances capital efficiency.

## Governance Model

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="ve3,3 Model">
    The ve3,3 governance model merges two powerful tokenomic paradigms:
    
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Vote-Escrow (ve)" icon="lock-hashtag">
        Requires tokens to be locked for extended periods to gain voting power and rewards
      </Card>
      <Card title="(3,3) Game Theory" icon="chess-king">
        Creates incentives for cooperative behavior that benefits the entire ecosystem
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
    
    This combination encourages long-term participation and aligns stakeholder interests toward protocol sustainability and growth.

## VOLA Token

The VOLA token is the native governance token of the protocol, serving as the cornerstone of the governance system.

### Token Utility

<Steps>
  <Step title="Protocol Governance">
    VOLA holders can vote on protocol parameters, upgrades, and resource allocation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Yield Enhancement">
    Locked VOLA (veVOLA) provides boosted rewards for protocol participants
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fee Distribution">
    VOLA holders receive a share of protocol revenue
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rebalancing Pool Direction">
    veVOLA holders can vote on reward allocations and protocol parameters
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Token Distribution

Total Supply: 100,000,000 VOLA

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Community Incentives" icon="users">
    **40%** (40,000,000 VOLA)
    
    4-year linear release
  </Card>
  <Card title="Team & Advisors" icon="user-group">
    **20%** (20,000,000 VOLA)
    
    2-year lock, then 2-year linear release
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ecosystem Development" icon="seedling">
    **20%** (20,000,000 VOLA)
    
    Released under governance control
  </Card>
  <Card title="Initial Liquidity" icon="water">
    **10%** (10,000,000 VOLA)
    
    Released at launch
  </Card>
  <Card title="Treasury" icon="vault">
    **10%** (10,000,000 VOLA)
    
    Released under governance control
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## veVOLA Mechanism

<Card>
  veVOLA is the core governance asset in VOLA Protocol, obtained by locking VOLA tokens for a specified period. The longer the lock period, the more veVOLA the user receives.
</Card>

### Locking Mechanism

<Columns>
  <Column>
    **Lock Period Options:**
    - Minimum: 1 week
    - Maximum: 4 years
    
    **veVOLA Calculation:**
    ```
    veVOLA = VOLA locked × (lock time / maximum lock time)
    ```
    
    **Example:**
    - 1,000 VOLA locked for 1 year (25% of max) = 250 veVOLA
    - 1,000 VOLA locked for 4 years (100% of max) = 1,000 veVOLA
  </Column>
  
  <Column>
    **Lock Characteristics:**
    
    - Once locked, tokens cannot be withdrawn until the lock period ends
    - veVOLA balance decreases linearly as the lock period approaches expiration
    - At lock expiration, veVOLA balance becomes zero and VOLA can be withdrawn
    - Lock period can be extended, but not shortened
    - Additional VOLA can be added to an existing lock
  </Column>
</Columns>

### veVOLA Benefits

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Voting Power" icon="check-to-slot">
    Participate in governance decisions, with voting weight proportional to veVOLA balance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Mining Boost" icon="rocket">
    Increase rewards in liquidity mining and Rebalancing Pool activities by up to 2.5x
  </Card>
  <Card title="Protocol Revenue" icon="money-bill-trend-up">
    Receive a share of protocol fees based on veVOLA holdings
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rebalancing Pool Voting" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
    Direct VOLA emissions to preferred strategies and pools
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  The veVOLA system is designed to reward long-term holders and active participants. The longer you lock your VOLA tokens, the greater your influence and benefits within the protocol.
</Note>

## Rebalancing Pool and Rewards

The Rebalancing Pool is both a risk management mechanism and a key channel for protocol rewards.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stake Assets">
    Users can stake USD.hype in the Rebalancing Pool and receive corresponding pool share tokens (spTokens)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Earn Rewards">
    Stakers earn VOLA rewards and a share of protocol fees
  </Step>
  <Step title="Boost with veVOLA">
    veVOLA holders receive up to 2.5x higher rewards based on their veVOLA balance
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim and Reinvest">
    Rewards can be claimed and potentially locked for veVOLA to compound benefits
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Reward Calculation

The base reward calculation for Rebalancing Pool participants:

```
User Reward = Pool Base Reward × (User Stake / Total Pool Stake) × User Boost Factor
```

User Boost Factor is determined by:

```
User Boost Factor = 1 + min(1.5, User veVOLA / (Total veVOLA × User Stake Ratio))
```

<Warning>
  The maximum boost factor is 2.5x, achieved through high veVOLA holdings relative to your stake in the Rebalancing Pool.
</Warning>

## Governance Process

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Proposal Creation">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Proposal Threshold">
        A user must hold at least 0.5% of total veVOLA to create a proposal
      </Step>
      <Step title="Draft Proposal">
        Author drafts a proposal including:
        - Description of changes
        - Technical implementation details
        - Expected impact
      </Step>
      <Step title="Discussion Period">
        Community discusses the proposal on the forum before formal submission
      </Step>
      <Step title="Formal Submission">
        Proposal is submitted to on-chain governance for voting
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Voting Process">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Voting Period">
        Proposals are open for voting for 5 days
      </Step>
      <Step title="Quorum Requirement">

      </Step>
      <Step title="Approval Threshold">
        At least 60% of voting veVOLA must approve for the proposal to pass
      </Step>
      <Step title="Timelock">
        Successfully passed proposals enter a 2-day timelock before implementation
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    
    <Note>
      Voting power is determined by a user's veVOLA balance at the time the proposal enters the voting phase.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Implementation">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Execution">
        After the timelock period, the proposal can be executed
      </Step>
      <Step title="Monitoring">
        The community monitors the implementation and effects
      </Step>
      <Step title="Feedback">
        Post-implementation feedback is collected for future improvements
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    
    <Warning>
      Emergency proposals with stronger security implications may require a higher approval threshold (75%) but can have a shorter timelock period in critical situations.
