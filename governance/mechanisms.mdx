## veVOLA Voting Power

<Card>
  The core of VOLA's governance system is veVOLA (vote-escrowed VOLA), which determines voting power based on both the amount of VOLA locked and the lock duration.
</Card>

### Voting Power Calculation

<Columns>
  <Column>
    ### Formula
    
    Voting power is calculated as:
    
    ```
    veVOLA = VOLA tokens ร (lock duration in weeks รท 208)
    ```
    
    Where 208 weeks represents the maximum 4-year lock period.
    
    This creates a system where longer commitments are rewarded with greater influence over protocol decisions.
  </Column>
  
  <Column>
    ### Examples
    
    - 1,000 VOLA locked for 4 years = 1,000 veVOLA (maximum)
    - 1,000 VOLA locked for 2 years = 500 veVOLA
    - 1,000 VOLA locked for 1 year = 250 veVOLA
    - 10,000 VOLA locked for 6 months = 1,250 veVOLA
    
    This system values both capital commitment and time commitment, creating alignment with long-term protocol success.
  </Column>
</Columns>

<Note>
  veVOLA balances decay linearly over time as the lock period progresses. For example, a 4-year lock will have half its original voting power after 2 years if not extended.
</Note>

## Governance Process

<Card>
  The VOLA governance process follows a structured flow designed to ensure thorough consideration, community input, and secure implementation.
</Card>

### Standard Proposal Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Idea Discussion">
    Community members discuss potential proposals in the governance forum and Discord to gather initial feedback.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Temperature Check">
    Initial non-binding poll to gauge community sentiment before formal proposal submission.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Formal Proposal">
    Creation of an official proposal following the standardized format, including implementation details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Discussion Period">
    7-day period for the community to review, discuss, and suggest modifications to the proposal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Voting Period">
    5-day on-chain voting period where veVOLA holders cast their votes (For, Against, or Abstain).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Timelock">
    Successful proposals enter a timelock period (variable based on proposal type) before execution.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execution">
    Automatic on-chain execution of the proposal after the timelock period completes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Proposals affecting critical protocol parameters or smart contracts have extended discussion periods, higher approval thresholds, and longer timelocks to ensure security.
</Warning>

## Proposal Types

<Card>
  VOLA governance supports different types of proposals, each with appropriate mechanisms based on impact and risk.
</Card>

## Governance Safety Mechanisms

<Card>
  VOLA Protocol implements multiple safety mechanisms to protect governance from exploitation, mistakes, or malicious action.
</Card>

### Security Measures

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Governance Guardian" icon="shield-halved">
    Multi-sig council with veto power for malicious proposals during initial phases
  </Card>
  <Card title="Timelocks" icon="clock">
    Mandatory delay between approval and execution to allow community reaction
  </Card>
  <Card title="Value-Based Thresholds" icon="money-bill">
    Higher approval requirements for higher-value decisions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Quorum Requirements" icon="users">
    Minimum participation thresholds to prevent low-turnout decisions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Snapshot Feature" icon="camera">
    Voting power determined at proposal submission to prevent tactical voting
  </Card>
  <Card title="Time-Weighted Voting" icon="hourglass">
    Vote power from long-term token locks limits governance attacks
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  During the initial phase of the protocol, a Guardian multi-sig has emergency veto power as a safety measure. This power will be phased out as the protocol matures and governance security is proven.
</Warning>

## Delegation System

<Card>
  VOLA governance includes a robust delegation system that allows veVOLA holders to delegate their voting power to trusted representatives without transferring their tokens or rewards.
</Card>

### Delegation Mechanics

<Steps>
  <Step title="Delegate Selection">
    veVOLA holders can delegate their voting power to any Ethereum address of their choice.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delegation Assignment">
    Delegation is configured through a simple transaction that assigns voting rights.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reward Separation">
    While voting power is delegated, all economic benefits remain with the original token holder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Flexible Management">
    Delegations can be changed or revoked at any time, effective immediately for future proposals.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Delegation helps increase governance participation by allowing passive holders to contribute their voting power while expert delegates can focus on active governance management.
</Note>

## Governance Incentives
