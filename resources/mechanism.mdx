# Mechanism Overview

This page provides a comprehensive technical overview of the core mechanisms that power the VOLA Protocol.

## Protocol Architecture

VOLA Protocol consists of two primary product lines, both built on robust technical foundations:

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Wave Protocol Mechanisms

The Wave Protocol employs several interconnected mechanisms to enable volatility separation:

### Collateralization System

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deposit Collateral">
    Users deposit sHYPE collateral into the protocol's smart contracts
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mint Synthetic Assets">
    Users can mint USD.hype (stablecoin) and HYPE.v (volatility token) against their collateral
  </Step>
  <Step title="Maintain Collateralization Ratio">
    The system enforces a minimum collateralization ratio (150%) at all times
  </Step>
  <Step title="Redemption Process">
    Users can redeem their synthetic assets back for the underlying collateral
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Leverage Calculation

The leverage for HYPE.v is calculated using the formula:

```
Leverage (L) = 1 + (1 / (CR - 100%))
```

Where CR is the system's current Collateralization Ratio.

### Rebalancing System

The Rebalancing Pool acts as both a stability mechanism and a yield opportunity:

- Users deposit USD.hype into the pool
- The pool actively maintains system health by purchasing collateral during downturns
- Participants earn rewards from protocol fees and trading profits

## hbHYPE Mechanisms

The hbHYPE liquid staking solution implements several key mechanisms:

### Staking Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deposit HYPE">
    Users deposit HYPE tokens into the liquid staking contract
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive hbHYPE">
    Users receive hbHYPE tokens representing their staked position
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validator Delegation">
    The protocol distributes staked HYPE across a carefully selected validator set
  </Step>
  <Step title="Value Accrual">
    As staking rewards accumulate, the value of hbHYPE increases relative to HYPE
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Reward Distribution

The reward distribution mechanism:
- Collects staking rewards from validators
- Updates the hbHYPE/HYPE exchange rate to reflect accumulated rewards
- Enables automatic compounding without rebasing
- Deducts a small protocol fee for sustainability

## Governance Mechanisms

VOLA Protocol governance utilizes a vote-escrowed token model:

- Users lock VOLA tokens to receive veVOLA
- veVOLA grants voting power proportional to amount locked and lock duration
- Governance proposals pass through a structured process with appropriate quorums
- Timelocks provide security against malicious proposals

## Technical Implementation

All VOLA Protocol mechanisms are implemented through secure, audited smart contracts:

- Modular architecture with well-defined interfaces
- Comprehensive security features including circuit breakers and access controls
- Gas-optimized for efficiency
- Formal verification of critical components
