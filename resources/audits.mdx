### Notable Findings and Resolutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Wave Protocol - Reentrancy Risk in Redemption Flow">
    **Severity:** High
    
    **Description:** A potential reentrancy vulnerability was identified in the redemption flow that could allow an attacker to withdraw more collateral than entitled.
    
    **Resolution:** Implemented the checks-effects-interactions pattern and added a reentrancy guard to the redemption function. Additional validation was added to ensure state consistency throughout the redemption process.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="hbHYPE - Validator Update Mechanism Vulnerability">
    **Severity:** High
    
    **Description:** Under specific conditions, the validator update mechanism could potentially be manipulated to redirect stake to unauthorized validators.
    
    **Resolution:** Implemented a multi-signature approval process for validator changes, added time-locks for validator updates, and enhanced access controls around the validator registry.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Governance - Timelock Bypass">
    **Severity:** Medium
    
    **Description:** A specific sequence of governance actions could potentially bypass the intended timelock on sensitive parameter changes.
    
    **Resolution:** Restructured the governance flow to enforce timelocks at the execution level rather than the proposal level, ensuring all parameter changes must wait the required timelock period.
