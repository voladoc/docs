  Alice has 1,000 HYPE and needs some funds unexpectedly after 3 days:
  
  - With Direct Staking: Must wait 7 days for unbonding, missing time-sensitive opportunity
  - With hbHYPE: Can immediately sell hbHYPE on secondary markets for needed liquidity
</Card>

### hbHYPE vs. Exchange Staking

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Security & Control">
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="hbHYPE" icon="shield-check">
        - Self-custody of tokens at all times
        - Non-custodial smart contracts
        - No counterparty risk
        - Transparent validator allocation
        - Open-source code
      </Card>
      <Card title="Exchange Staking" icon="building-columns">
        - Exchange custody of tokens
        - Counterparty risk of exchange
        - Limited transparency
        - Potential regulatory issues
        - Subject to exchange-specific risks
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
    
    <Note>
      The self-custody nature of hbHYPE aligns with the core crypto principle of "not your keys, not your coins," whereas exchange staking requires surrendering control of your assets.

  <Tab title="Rewards & Yield">
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="hbHYPE" icon="chart-line">

        - Limited additional yield options
        - Hidden fees and costs
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
    
    <Warning>
      Exchanges typically retain a significant portion of staking rewards and almost always retain airdrops, significantly reducing the total return profile compared to hbHYPE.

    | Fee Type | hbHYPE | Direct Staking | Exchange Staking |
    | :------- | :----- | :------------- | :--------------- |

## User Scenarios

<Card>
  Different staking options serve different user needs. Here's how they compare for specific scenarios:
</Card>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Long-term Holder">
    If you plan to hold HYPE for an extended period (1+ years):
    
    - **Best Option**: hbHYPE
    - **Rationale**: Maximizes returns through staking rewards, airdrop capture, and additional yield opportunities while maintaining flexibility if your plans change
    - **Alternative**: Direct staking if you have technical expertise and strong validator connections
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Active Trader">
    If you actively trade and value liquidity above all:
    
    - **Best Option**: hbHYPE or No Staking
    - **Rationale**: hbHYPE provides staking returns while maintaining liquidity; holding unstaked gives maximum flexibility
    - **Consideration**: The opportunity cost of not staking may be significant over time
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="DeFi Power User">
    If you're experienced in DeFi and want to maximize capital efficiency:
    
    - **Best Option**: hbHYPE
    - **Rationale**: Enables staking while using the liquid token throughout DeFi for additional yield strategies
    - **Strategies**: Provide liquidity, use as collateral, participate in yield farms
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Security-Focused User">
    If minimizing risk is your primary concern:
    
    - **Best Option**: No Staking or Direct Staking
    - **Rationale**: Eliminates smart contract risk and reduces exposure to third-party systems
    - **Trade-off**: Sacrifices potential returns for increased security
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Migration Considerations

<Card>
  If you're currently using another staking method and considering switching to hbHYPE:
</Card>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assess Current Position">
    Evaluate your current staking arrangement, noting unbonding periods and pending rewards
  </Step>
  <Step title="Timing Optimization">
    Plan migration to minimize lost rewards during transition periods
  </Step>
  <Step title="Gradual Migration">
    Consider moving a portion of your stake initially to test the experience
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tax Considerations">
    Be aware of potential tax implications of switching staking providers (consult a tax professional)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  If currently using direct staking, remember that the 7-day unbonding period must complete before those tokens can be staked with hbHYPE.
