### Simplified User Experience

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Traditional Staking Complexity">
    Traditional staking on Hyperliquid typically requires users to:
    
    1. Research and select validators from dozens of options
    2. Understand technical parameters like commission rates and voting power
    3. Monitor validator performance and potential slashing risks
    4. Manually claim rewards and decide on reinvestment
    5. Manage the unbonding process when ready to unstake
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="hbHYPE Simplicity">
    With hbHYPE liquid staking, the process is dramatically simplified:
    
    1. Deposit HYPE tokens in a single transaction
    2. Automatically receive hbHYPE at the current exchange rate
    3. No validator selection or monitoring needed
    4. Rewards accrue automatically into hbHYPE's value
    5. Redeem anytime with a simple transaction (subject to network unbonding period)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This streamlined approach makes staking accessible to all users, regardless of their technical expertise or time availability.

### Risk Management Benefits

<Card>
  hbHYPE employs a sophisticated risk management approach through validator diversification and active monitoring.
</Card>

When you stake directly, your entire stake is typically with one or a few validators. If a validator experiences issues, your entire position could be at risk.

With hbHYPE, your stake is:

- Distributed across carefully selected validators
- Continuously monitored by protocol security experts
- Protected by diversification from single-validator failures
- Professionally managed to minimize slashing risks

<Warning>
  While hbHYPE's risk management approach significantly reduces risks, all staking activities carry some level of risk. Please review our [risk management](/liquid-staking/risk-management) page for detailed information.
