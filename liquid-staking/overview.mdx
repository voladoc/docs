# Liquid Staking with hbHYPE

## Introducing hbHYPE: Seamlessly Stake HYPE, Maximize Rewards

hbHYPE is VOLA Protocol's liquid staking derivative for the Hyperliquid network, designed to provide HYPE token holders with a simple, secure, and highly rewarding way to participate in network consensus and earn staking yields.

By staking HYPE through VOLA, users receive hbHYPE, an interest-bearing token that represents their staked HYPE and accrued rewards, all while maintaining full liquidity and composability within the DeFi ecosystem.

## Decentralized Community Staking

Our approach emphasizes **decentralized community staking**, distributing HYPE across a carefully selected network of community and professional validators.

    ### Network Security
    
    This strategy enhances network security by avoiding single points of failure and contributing to the decentralization of the Hyperliquid network.
    
    By distributing stake across multiple validators, we also reduce the impact of any potential validator issues on your staked assets.
  </Column>
  <Column>
    ### Airdrop Optimization
    
    Our validator selection and distribution strategy is designed to strategically position our users to **capture a wider range of airdrop opportunities**.
    
    Many projects in the ecosystem distribute airdrops based on validator participation, and our wide distribution increases the chances of qualifying for these rewards.

</Columns>

<Note>
  VOLA Protocol is committed to passing through 100% of captured ecosystem airdrops to hbHYPE holders, amplifying your overall yield beyond the base staking return.
