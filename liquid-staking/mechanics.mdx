# Liquid Staking Mechanics

This page explains the technical mechanics behind VOLA Protocol's liquid staking solution, helping you understand how hbHYPE works under the hood.

## Core Mechanism

<Frame>
  ![Liquid Staking Mechanics](/images/liquid-staking-mechanics.png)
</Frame>

The hbHYPE liquid staking system operates through a well-defined process that maintains both security and liquidity.

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Deposits HYPE">
    Users deposit their HYPE tokens into VOLA Protocol's smart contracts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Smart Contract Issues hbHYPE">
    The protocol mints hbHYPE tokens at the current exchange rate, representing the user's staked position.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Protocol Stakes HYPE">
    The deposited HYPE is staked across a diversified set of validators on the Hyperliquid network.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Staking Rewards Accrue">
    As staking rewards are generated, they're reinvested automatically to compound returns.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Exchange Rate Increases">
    The hbHYPE/HYPE exchange rate increases over time, reflecting accrued rewards.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Redemption Process">
    When users redeem hbHYPE, they receive the equivalent amount of HYPE plus accrued rewards, subject to the network unbonding period.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Exchange Rate Mechanism

The hbHYPE token uses an accumulative (non-rebasing) exchange rate model:

<Card>
  **Exchange Rate Calculation:**
  
  ```
  hbHYPE/HYPE Exchange Rate = Total HYPE Managed by Protocol / Total hbHYPE Supply
  ```
  
  This rate increases as staking rewards accrue, meaning each hbHYPE token becomes worth more HYPE over time.
</Card>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Initial State">
    When the protocol launches:
    
    - 1 hbHYPE = 1 HYPE (initial 1:1 ratio)
    - User deposits 100 HYPE → Receives 100 hbHYPE
    - Total HYPE managed: 100
    - Total hbHYPE supply: 100
    - Exchange rate: 1.0
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="After Rewards">
    After staking rewards accrue:
    
    - Protocol now manages 103 HYPE (original 100 + 3 in rewards)
    - Total hbHYPE supply remains 100
    - New exchange rate: 103/100 = 1.03
    - 1 hbHYPE is now worth 1.03 HYPE
    - User's 100 hbHYPE is now worth 103 HYPE
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Deposit After Rewards">
    New user deposits after rewards have accrued:
    
    - Current exchange rate is 1.03
    - User deposits 100 HYPE
    - User receives 100/1.03 = 97.09 hbHYPE
    - This 97.09 hbHYPE is worth 100 HYPE at current rate
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  This token model means hbHYPE balances remain constant while their value in HYPE increases over time, simplifying integration with other DeFi protocols compared to rebasing tokens.
</Note>

## Validator Selection and Management

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Decentralized Approach" icon="network-wired">
    HYPE is distributed across multiple validators to enhance security and decentralization
  </Card>
  <Card title="Selection Criteria" icon="filter">
    Validators are selected based on performance, reliability, security, and community impact
  </Card>
  <Card title="Continuous Monitoring" icon="eye">
    Validator performance is continuously monitored for optimal returns and security
  </Card>
  <Card title="Strategic Adjustment" icon="sliders">
    Validator distribution is adjusted based on performance and airdrop optimization
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Validator Diversification Strategy

<Columns>
  <Column>
    **Diversification Categories:**
    
    - **Performance-optimized validators**: Selected for maximum staking yields
    - **Community validators**: Supporting network decentralization
    - **Ecosystem validators**: Strategic positioning for airdrop capture
    - **Infrastructure providers**: Professional validation services
  </Column>
  
  <Column>
    **Allocation Strategy:**
    
    Exact allocation percentages are adjusted dynamically based on:
    - Historical performance metrics
    - Security assessments
    - Commission rate changes
    - Ecosystem airdrop patterns
    - Community governance decisions
  </Column>
</Columns>

## Deposit and Minting Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Initiates Deposit">
    User connects wallet to the VOLA App and specifies HYPE amount to stake.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Smart Contract Interaction">
    User approves the HYPE token transfer and confirms the staking transaction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Exchange Rate Check">
    Smart contract retrieves the current hbHYPE/HYPE exchange rate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="hbHYPE Calculation">
    ```
    hbHYPE to mint = HYPE deposited / current exchange rate
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Minting">
    Protocol mints the calculated hbHYPE amount and transfers it to the user.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stake Distribution">
    Protocol distributes the deposited HYPE across validators according to the allocation strategy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Minimum Deposit and Fees

<Card>
  - **Minimum Deposit**: No minimum (gas costs make very small deposits inefficient)
  - **Deposit Fee**: 0% (protocol covers gas costs for staking operations)
  - **Management Fee**: Small percentage of staking rewards to sustain protocol operations
</Card>

## Redemption and Unbonding

The redemption process handles the conversion of hbHYPE back to HYPE:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Initiates Redemption">
    User specifies amount of hbHYPE to redeem for HYPE.
  </Step>
  <Step title="hbHYPE Burning">
    The specified hbHYPE tokens are burned from user's wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="HYPE Calculation">
    ```
    HYPE to receive = hbHYPE redeemed × current exchange rate
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Unbonding Process">
    Protocol initiates unbonding of equivalent HYPE from validators.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Waiting Period">
    User waits through the Hyperliquid network's mandatory unbonding period (~7 days).
  </Step>
  <Step title="HYPE Distribution">
    After the unbonding period, HYPE is transferred to the user's wallet.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Redemption Options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Standard Redemption">
    - Subject to the network's unbonding period (~7 days)
    - No redemption fee
    - Receives full value in HYPE based on current exchange rate
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Liquidity Markets">
    - For users who need immediate liquidity
    - Trade hbHYPE for other assets on secondary markets
    - Subject to market rates and slippage
    - Bypass unbonding period
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
  During the unbonding period, your HYPE stops earning staking rewards, but your position is secured and will be delivered after the unbonding completes.
</Warning>

## Reward Collection and Distribution

<Card>
  Staking rewards are handled automatically by the protocol:
  
  1. **Collection**: Protocol collects staking rewards from validators
  2. **Reinvestment**: Rewards are automatically restaked to compound returns
  3. **Value Accrual**: As rewards are restaked, the hbHYPE/HYPE exchange rate increases
  4. **User Benefit**: All hbHYPE holders benefit proportionally from rewards
</Card>

### Reward Types

The protocol manages multiple reward streams:

| Reward Type | Source | Distribution Method |
| :---------- | :----- | :----------------- |
| Base Staking Rewards | HYPE network inflation | Automatic (via exchange rate) |
| Validator Commission Rebates | Optional validator partnerships | Automatic (via exchange rate) |
| Ecosystem Airdrops | HYPE ecosystem projects | Passed through to hbHYPE holders |
| VOLA Protocol Incentives | VOLA token emissions | According to governance decisions |
