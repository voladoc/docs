## Detailed Strategy Explanations

### Risk-Free Leverage with HYPE.v

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deposit Collateral">
    Deposit sHYPE to the Wave Protocol.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mint HYPE.v">
    Choose to mint HYPE.v only (for maximum leverage).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Benefit from Floating Leverage">
    HYPE.v automatically adjusts its leverage based on the protocol's Collateralization Ratio.
  </Step>
  <Step title="No Liquidation Risk">
    Unlike traditional leverage platforms, your position can never be liquidated.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Exit Strategy">
    When ready, redeem your HYPE.v for the underlying sHYPE.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Key Benefits:**
- No liquidation risk
- No ongoing funding fees
- Automatic leverage adjustment
- No required margin maintenance
- Full position ownership

<Note>
  While HYPE.v positions cannot be forcibly liquidated, they still carry market risk. In extreme market conditions, HYPE.v value could approach zero if the system's Collateralization Ratio approaches 100%.
</Note>

### Creating Stable Assets with USD.hype

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic Stability">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Deposit Collateral">
        Deposit sHYPE to the Wave Protocol.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Mint USD.hype">
        Choose to mint USD.hype only, based on the current allowed mint ratio.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Use as Stable Currency">
        USD.hype maintains a stable $1 value regardless of sHYPE price movements.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Exit When Ready">
        When desired, redeem USD.hype for sHYPE at current market rates.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    
    **Example:**
    - Deposit 1,000 sHYPE at $10 each (total value: $10,000)
    - With a 200% Collateralization Ratio minimum, you can mint up to 5,000 USD.hype
    - If sHYPE price drops to $5, your USD.hype still maintains its $1 value
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Stable Yield Farming">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Mint USD.hype">
        Follow the basic stability steps to mint USD.hype.

### Custom Risk Profiles

<Frame>
  ![Risk Profile Slider](/images/risk-slider.png)
</Frame>

VOLA allows users to create custom risk profiles by minting USD.hype and HYPE.v in different ratios:

| Strategy | Ratio (USD.hype:HYPE.v) | Risk Profile | Suitable For |
| :------- | :---------------------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| Full Stability | 100:0 | Zero price exposure | Risk-averse users seeking stability |
| Conservative | 75:25 | Reduced downside, modest upside | Cautious investors with stability preference |
| Balanced | 50:50 | Moderate price exposure | Balanced risk-reward seekers |
| Growth | 25:75 | Higher volatility exposure | Growth-oriented investors |
| Maximum Leverage | 0:100 | Full leveraged exposure | Risk-seeking traders |

<Card>
  **How to Create a Custom Risk Profile:**
  
  1. Deposit sHYPE to the Wave Protocol
  2. Choose your desired allocation between USD.hype and HYPE.v
  3. The protocol will mint both assets according to your selection
  4. Adjust your position anytime by minting/redeeming either asset
</Card>

### Dual Asset Strategy

This strategy involves holding both USD.hype and HYPE.v in a 1:1 ratio to replicate the exposure of the underlying sHYPE while benefiting from increased capital efficiency.

<Columns>
  <Column>
    **Traditional Holding:**
    - 10 sHYPE @ $100 = $1,000 total value
    - Capital is locked in a single asset
    - Limited utility beyond price appreciation
  </Column>
  <Column>
    **Dual Asset Strategy:**
    - Convert 10 sHYPE into:
      - 500 USD.hype (stable $1 value) = $500
      - HYPE.v equivalent to $500
    - Same economic exposure to sHYPE
    - USD.hype can be deployed elsewhere for yield
  </Column>
</Columns>

<Note>
  The Dual Asset Strategy provides the same price exposure as holding the original asset but unlocks half of your capital for other opportunities while maintaining the original economic exposure.
</Note>

### Liquid Staking with hbHYPE

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stake HYPE">
    Deposit your HYPE tokens into the VOLA liquid staking contract.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive hbHYPE">
    Get hbHYPE tokens representing your staked position at the current exchange rate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use hbHYPE in DeFi">
    Deploy your hbHYPE in other DeFi protocols while earning staking rewards.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Benefit from Appreciation">
    hbHYPE's value against HYPE increases over time as staking rewards accrue.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Unstake When Ready">
    Redeem hbHYPE for HYPE when desired (subject to unbonding period).
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Key Benefits:**
- Earn ~2.9% APY from native staking
- Maintain liquidity of staked assets
- Maximize airdrop capture through distributed validator staking
