## Detailed Product Descriptions

### Wave Protocol (Volatility Separation Engine)

<Card>
  The Wave Protocol is VOLA's innovative volatility separation engine that allows users to decompose the risk-return profile of a single asset (sHYPE) into two distinct components:
  
  * **USD.hype**: A fully stable USD-pegged token that eliminates all price volatility
  * **HYPE.v**: A floating-leverage position that absorbs all market volatility
</Card>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="USD.hype">
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-2">
      <Icon name="dollar-sign" size="md" className="text-green-500" />
      <span className="font-semibold text-lg">The Stable Component</span>
    </div>
    
    **USD.hype** is the stable-value asset within the VOLA Protocol, characterized by:
    
    * Complete isolation from price volatility
    * Constant value of $1 USD
    * Target audience: Users seeking capital preservation and stable value
    
    The stability of USD.hype at $1 is upheld by the protocol's over-collateralization strategy and dynamic risk management mechanisms.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="HYPE.v">
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-2">
      <Icon name="chart-line" size="md" className="text-blue-500" />
      <span className="font-semibold text-lg">The Volatility Component</span>
    </div>
    
    **HYPE.v** is the component that embodies volatility, with these key features:
    
    * Absorption of all price volatility from the base collateral
    * Floating leverage multiple that adjusts based on system Collateralization Ratio
    * Target audience: Users seeking amplified returns without liquidation risk
    
    HYPE.v offers the unique benefit of leveraged exposure without liquidation risk, as its leverage adjusts automatically in response to market conditions.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  The Wave Protocol's innovative "no liquidation risk" design means users are not subject to traditional forced selling of their positions. However, users should understand that HYPE.v's value is still subject to market risk and can theoretically reach zero in extreme market conditions.
</Note>
