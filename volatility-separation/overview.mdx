# Volatility Separation Engine

## Introduction

VOLA Protocol's Volatility Separation Engine is an innovative financial primitive designed to meticulously decouple and redistribute the inherent price volatility of sHYPE (the base crypto asset).

This engine precisely separates a single asset's risk-return profile into two distinct, complementary financial instruments:

  <Card title="USD.hype" icon="dollar-sign">
    A stable asset that maintains $1 value regardless of market conditions
  </Card>
  <Card title="HYPE.v" icon="chart-line">
    A volatility component with floating leverage and no liquidation risk
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deposit Collateral">
    Users deposit sHYPE as collateral into the Wave Protocol.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mint Financial Instruments">
    The protocol mints USD.hype and/or HYPE.v tokens based on the user's preference.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Volatility Separation">
    USD.hype absorbs none of the price volatility (stable at $1)
    HYPE.v absorbs all of the price volatility (with floating leverage)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automated Risk Management">
    The protocol continuously manages the system's Collateralization Ratio and dynamically adjusts HYPE.v's leverage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Redemption">
    Users can redeem their USD.hype and/or HYPE.v for the underlying sHYPE at any time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Components

### USD.hype: The Stable Layer

<Card>
  USD.hype serves as the stable-value asset within the VOLA Protocol, characterized by:
  
  - **Complete Isolation from Price Volatility**: USD.hype maintains its value regardless of sHYPE price fluctuations
  - **Constant Value of $1 USD**: Each USD.hype token is designed to consistently hold a value of 1 US Dollar
  - **Target Audience**: Designed for users who prioritize capital preservation and are averse to price volatility
</Card>

The stability of USD.hype at $1 is upheld through a robust over-collateralization strategy and dynamic risk management mechanisms. As the price of sHYPE changes, the protocol adjusts HYPE.v's value and leverage to shield USD.hype from volatility.

### HYPE.v: The Volatility Layer

<Card>
  HYPE.v embodies all the price volatility from the underlying collateral, featuring:
  
  - **Absorption of All Price Volatility**: HYPE.v absorbs the entirety of price fluctuations from sHYPE
  - **Floating Leverage Multiple**: HYPE.v's leverage automatically adjusts based on the system's Collateralization Ratio
  - **No Liquidation Risk**: Unlike traditional leveraged positions, HYPE.v positions are never forcibly liquidated
  - **Target Audience**: Tailored for users who seek amplified returns and understand the associated risks
</Card>

When sHYPE price increases, HYPE.v value increases by a greater percentage due to its inherent leverage. Conversely, when sHYPE price decreases, HYPE.v experiences a larger percentage decrease.

<Note>
  HYPE.v's "no liquidation risk" design means users are never subject to forced selling of their positions due to market movements. However, in extreme market conditions where the system's Collateralization Ratio approaches 100%, HYPE.v's value could approach zero.
</Note>

## Core Mechanisms

### Value Invariant Principle

The foundation of the Volatility Separation Engine is a mathematical invariant ensuring that the total value of all synthetic assets (USD.hype and HYPE.v) equals the total value of sHYPE collateral:

```
sHYPE Total Value ($) = (USD.hype Total Supply × $1) + (HYPE.v Total Supply × HYPE.v Price)
```

This invariant guarantees that the system remains fully collateralized at all times, while providing the mathematical basis for transferring volatility from USD.hype to HYPE.v.

### Dynamic Leverage Mechanism

HYPE.v features a dynamic leverage multiple that adjusts automatically based on the protocol's Collateralization Ratio (CR):

```
Leverage (L) = 1 + (1 / (CR - 100%))
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Concept">
    As the system's Collateralization Ratio changes, HYPE.v's leverage automatically adjusts:
    
    - **Higher CR**: Lower leverage, lower risk, lower potential returns
    - **Lower CR**: Higher leverage, higher risk, higher potential returns
    
    This mechanism ensures the system remains solvent while distributing risk appropriately.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Example">
    If the Collateralization Ratio is 200%:
    
    ```
    Leverage = 1 + (1 / (200% - 100%)) = 1 + (1 / 100%) = 1 + 1 = 2x
    ```
    
    At 200% CR, HYPE.v offers 2x leverage. If sHYPE price increases by 10%, HYPE.v value would increase by approximately 20%.
    
    If CR decreases to 150%:
    
    ```
    Leverage = 1 + (1 / (150% - 100%)) = 1 + (1 / 50%) = 1 + 2 = 3x
    ```
    
    At 150% CR, HYPE.v now offers 3x leverage. The same 10% sHYPE price increase would result in approximately 30% gain for HYPE.v.

### Risk Management Framework

The Volatility Separation Engine employs a comprehensive risk management framework:
