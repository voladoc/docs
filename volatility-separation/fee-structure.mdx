## Minting Fees

<Card>
  Minting fees are charged when users create USD.hype and/or HYPE.v from their deposited collateral.
</Card>

### Base Minting Fee

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Structure">
    <div className="mb-4">
      The base minting fee has two components:
    </div>
    
    - **Fixed Component**: 0.25% - Applied to all minting operations
    - **Variable Component**: 0-0.75% - Adjusts based on system conditions
    
    <Note>
      Total base minting fee ranges from 0.25% to 1.0% of the operation's value, depending on current system parameters.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Calculation">
    <div className="mb-4">
      Minting fees are calculated as a percentage of the dollar value of synthetic assets being created:
    </div>
    
    ```
    Minting Fee = (USD.hype Value + HYPE.v Value) × Fee Rate
    ```
    
    The fee is paid in the collateral asset (sHYPE), deducted from the amount used for minting.
    
    **Example:**
    - Minting $1,000 worth of synthetic assets
    - Base fee rate: 0.5%
    - Fee amount: $1,000 × 0.5% = $5 (paid in sHYPE equivalent)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Dynamic Fee Modifiers

The variable component of the minting fee adjusts based on system conditions to incentivize system-balancing behaviors:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="CR-Based Adjustment" icon="chart-line">
    Fees increase as the system Collateralization Ratio (CR) decreases, discouraging further USD.hype minting when the system has lower collateralization
  </Card>
  <Card title="Volatility Adjustment" icon="wave-square">
    Fees increase during periods of high market volatility to provide additional system protection
  </Card>
  <Card title="Directional Skew Adjustment" icon="arrows-left-right">
    Fees adjust based on the balance between USD.hype and HYPE.v demand to encourage balanced usage
  </Card>
  <Card title="Growth Adjustment" icon="chart-line-up">
    Fees may be reduced during growth phases to encourage adoption (governance-controlled)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  During extreme market conditions, minting fees may temporarily increase above the standard range to protect system stability.
</Warning>

## Redemption Fees

<Card>
  Redemption fees are applied when users convert their synthetic assets (USD.hype and/or HYPE.v) back into the underlying collateral.
</Card>

### Base Redemption Fee

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Structure">
    <div className="mb-4">
      The base redemption fee structure:
    </div>
    
    - **Fixed Component**: 0.2% - Applied to all redemption operations
    - **Variable Component**: 0-0.5% - Adjusts based on system conditions
    
    <Note>
      Total base redemption fee ranges from 0.2% to 0.7% of the operation's value, typically lower than minting fees to ensure exit liquidity.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Calculation">
    <div className="mb-4">
      Redemption fees are calculated as a percentage of the dollar value of synthetic assets being redeemed:
    </div>
    
    ```
    Redemption Fee = (USD.hype Value + HYPE.v Value) × Fee Rate
    ```
    
    The fee is deducted from the collateral amount returned to the user.
    
    **Example:**
    - Redeeming $1,000 worth of synthetic assets
    - Base fee rate: 0.3%
    - Fee amount: $1,000 × 0.3% = $3 (deducted from returned collateral)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Dynamic Redemption Fee Modifiers

The variable component of the redemption fee adjusts based on system conditions:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="CR-Based Adjustment" icon="chart-line">
    Fees decrease as the system CR decreases, incentivizing redemptions that help increase the system's collateralization
  </Card>
  <Card title="Size Adjustment" icon="maximize">
    Large redemptions may incur slightly higher fees to prevent market impact
  </Card>
  <Card title="Time-Based Fee" icon="clock">
    Early redemptions within a short period after minting may incur a slightly higher fee
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stability Adjustment" icon="shield">
    Fees may be reduced during periods of market stress to encourage system rebalancing
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  In some extreme cases, redemption fees may be temporarily reduced to zero to encourage synthetic asset redemptions when beneficial for system health.
</Note>

## Fee Schedule Examples

<Card>
  **Example Fee Scenarios Based on System Conditions**
  
  | System State | CR Level | Minting Fee | Redemption Fee | Rationale |
  | :----------- | :------- | :---------- | :------------- | :-------- |
  | Healthy | >250% | 0.25% | 0.3% | Low fees during healthy conditions |
  | Normal | 200-250% | 0.5% | 0.3% | Standard fee environment |
  | Caution | 175-200% | 0.75% | 0.25% | Higher mint fees, lower redemption fees |
  | Alert | 150-175% | 1.0% | 0.2% | Discourage minting, encourage redemption |
  | Emergency | <150% | 1.5%+ | 0.1% | Strongly discourage minting, strongly encourage redemption |
</Card>

## Fee Changes and Governance

<Card>
  While the dynamic components of fees adjust automatically based on system conditions, the base fee structure and major parameters are governed by VOLA token holders.
</Card>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fee Change Proposal">
    A governance proposal to modify fee parameters is submitted
  </Step>
  <Step title="Community Discussion">
    The proposal undergoes community review and discussion period
  </Step>
  <Step title="Voting Period">
    veVOLA holders vote on the proposal, with voting power proportional to their veVOLA holdings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implementation">
    If approved, changes are implemented with a time delay for user adjustment
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Fee parameters critical to system safety have additional safeguards, including minimum quorum requirements and longer implementation delays.

</CardGroup>

## Cost Optimization Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Timing Your Operations">
    Fee-sensitive users may benefit from monitoring system conditions and timing their operations when fees are lower. The protocol's CR tends to fluctuate throughout market cycles, creating opportunities for lower fees.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="veVOLA Optimization">
    Strategically locking VOLA for veVOLA can provide significant fee savings for active users. The optimal lock period depends on your expected transaction volume and frequency.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Batch Processing">
    Combining multiple small operations into fewer larger operations can reduce the overall fee impact, as you'll incur fewer separate transaction fees.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="System Alignment">
    Performing operations that align with system health (e.g., redeeming USD.hype when CR is low, or minting when CR is high) can benefit from more favorable fee conditions.
  </Accordion>
