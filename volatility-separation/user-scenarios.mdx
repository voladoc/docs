Let's explore specific scenarios for each of these user types.

## The Stable Seeker

<Card>
  **Profile**: Risk-averse users who prioritize capital preservation and stability while still participating in the crypto ecosystem.
</Card>

### Scenario: Full Stability Strategy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deposit Collateral">
    Alice deposits 100 sHYPE (worth $1,000 at $10 per sHYPE) into the Wave Protocol.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mint Only USD.hype">
    With a 200% minimum Collateralization Ratio, Alice mints 500 USD.hype (worth \$500).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hold or Deploy USD.hype">
    Alice holds USD.hype as a stable asset or deploys it in low-risk DeFi protocols.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Market Downturn">
    The market experiences a downturn, with sHYPE price dropping to \$5 (50% decrease).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Outcome">
    Alice's 500 USD.hype maintains its \$500 value despite the market crash.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  By minting only USD.hype, Alice has effectively converted half of her volatile crypto exposure into a stable asset, protecting that portion from any market downturns. This strategy is ideal for users who want partial protection from market volatility.
</Note>

### Stable Farming Extension

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Strategy">
    Building on the stability strategy, Alice deploys her 500 USD.hype in stablecoin yield farms:

    1. Provides liquidity in USD.hype/USDC pools
    2. Stakes USD.hype in lending protocols
    3. Participates in stable yield aggregators

    This approach allows her to earn yield (typically 3-8% APR) on her stable assets while maintaining complete protection from sHYPE price volatility.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Risk Considerations">
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Low Market Risk" icon="chart-line-down">
        Protected from sHYPE price volatility
      </Card>
      <Card title="Protocol Risk" icon="file-code">
        Smart contract risk in chosen DeFi protocols
      </Card>
      <Card title="Opportunity Cost" icon="hourglass-half">
        Missing potential upside if sHYPE price increases
      </Card>
      <Card title="Collateral Lock" icon="lock">
        Original sHYPE remains locked in the protocol
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
    <Note>
      This strategy is ideal for conservative users in uncertain or bearish market conditions.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## The Leverage Hunter

<Card>
  **Profile**: Risk-embracing users who seek amplified returns and are comfortable with higher volatility for the potential of greater gains.
</Card>

### Scenario: Maximum Leverage Strategy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deposit Collateral">
    Bob deposits 100 sHYPE (worth $1,000 at $10 per sHYPE) into the Wave Protocol.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mint Only HYPE.v">
    Bob chooses to mint only HYPE.v, maximizing his leverage exposure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Market Movement">
    The market experiences a 20% upswing, with sHYPE price rising to \$12.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Amplified Returns">
    With the system at 200% CR, HYPE.v has a leverage of 2x, resulting in approximately 40% gain on Bob's position.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Outcome">
    Bob's HYPE.v position is now worth $1,400, a $400 gain (40%) on his initial \$1,000 investment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  The Maximum Leverage Strategy also amplifies losses in market downturns. If sHYPE price had dropped 20%, Bob's position would have lost approximately 40% of its value. While there is no liquidation risk, HYPE.v can theoretically approach zero value in extreme market conditions.
</Warning>

### Leverage Strategy Variations

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Strategic Timing">
    <div className="mb-4">
    Some users implement a timing approach:

    </div>

    1. Enter the HYPE.v position when market indicators suggest bullish momentum
    2. Hold through the anticipated uptrend to capture amplified gains
    3. Exit to stablecoins or USD.hype when market indicators turn bearish
    4. Re-enter when conditions appear favorable again

    This approach attempts to capture amplified upside while reducing exposure during downturns.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Partial Leverage">
    <div className="mb-4">
    A more moderate approach:

    </div>

    1. Deposit 100 sHYPE worth \$1,000
    2. Mint 250 USD.hype (\$250) and HYPE.v with the remaining collateral
    3. Keep USD.hype as a safety buffer or deploy in stable yield strategies
    4. Maintain HYPE.v for leveraged upside exposure

    This provides leveraged exposure while maintaining a stable component, reducing overall portfolio volatility.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## The Balanced Investor

<Card>
  **Profile**: Users seeking a middle ground between stability and upside potential, comfortable with moderate risk for moderate returns.
</Card>

### Scenario: 50/50 Balanced Strategy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deposit Collateral">
    Carol deposits 100 sHYPE (worth $1,000 at $10 per sHYPE) into the Wave Protocol.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mint Balanced Ratio">
    With a 200% CR, Carol mints 250 USD.hype ($250) and HYPE.v representing the remaining $750 of position value.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Market Upswing">
    The market rises 20%, with sHYPE price increasing to \$12.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Partial Amplification">
    Carol's USD.hype remains stable at \$250, while her HYPE.v position increases by approximately 26.7% (reflecting the amplified exposure).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Outcome">
    Carol's combined position value is now $1,200 ($250 in USD.hype \+ \$950 in HYPE.v), a 20% total return.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  In this balanced strategy, Carol's returns track the underlying sHYPE but with a modified risk profile. Her downside is partially protected by the USD.hype component, while still maintaining significant upside potential.
</Note>

### Risk-Return Customization

<Card>
  **Custom Risk Profiles**

  The 50/50 strategy is just one point on the risk-return spectrum. Users can precisely calibrate their risk exposure by adjusting the USD.hype to HYPE.v ratio:

  | USD.hype : HYPE.v Ratio | Risk Profile      | Downside Protection | Upside Potential |
  | :---------------------- | :---------------- | :------------------ | :--------------- |
  | 80:20                   | Very Conservative | High                | Limited          |
  | 60:40                   | Conservative      | Moderate-High       | Moderate-Low     |
  | 50:50                   | Balanced          | Moderate            | Moderate         |
  | 40:60                   | Growth-Oriented   | Moderate-Low        | Moderate-High    |
  | 20:80                   | Aggressive        | Low                 | High             |
</Card>

## The Yield Farmer

<Card>
  **Profile**: Yield-focused users who prioritize generating ongoing returns from their assets through various DeFi strategies.
</Card>

### Scenario: Dual Yield Strategy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deposit Collateral">
    Dave deposits 100 sHYPE (worth $1,000 at $10 per sHYPE) into the Wave Protocol.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mint Both Components">
    Dave mints 400 USD.hype ($400) and HYPE.v representing the remaining $600 of position value.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy USD.hype">
    Dave provides his 400 USD.hype as liquidity in stablecoin pairs, earning ~5% APR.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy HYPE.v">
    Dave stakes his HYPE.v in protocol incentive programs, earning an additional ~10% APR.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Outcome">
    Dave earns yield on both components while maintaining exposure to sHYPE price movements (though with modified risk profile).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Yield Calculation">
    <div className="mb-4">
    Dave's annual yield calculation:

    </div>

    - USD.hype yield: $400 × 5% = $20 per year
    - HYPE.v yield: $600 × 10% = $60 per year
    - Total yield: $80 per year on $1,000 deposit = 8% APR
    - Plus: Modified exposure to sHYPE price movements

    <Note>
      This yield is in addition to any price appreciation of the underlying position, creating a dual return source.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Advanced Extensions">
    <div className="mb-4">
    More sophisticated yield farmers might implement:

    </div>

    - **Recursive Strategies**: Using USD.hype as collateral in lending platforms to borrow more assets
    - **Yield Hopping**: Actively moving assets between protocols to capture the highest yields
    - **Incentive Maximization**: Focusing on protocols offering bonus tokens or reward multipliers
    - **Compounding Automation**: Using yield aggregators to automatically compound returns

    <Warning>
      Advanced strategies typically introduce additional layers of smart contract risk and complexity.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## The Capital Optimizer

<Card>
  **Profile**: Users looking to enhance capital efficiency while maintaining exposure to the underlying asset, focusing on unlocking liquidity from their holdings.
</Card>

### Scenario: Dual Asset Strategy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deposit Collateral">
    Emma deposits 100 sHYPE (worth $1,000 at $10 per sHYPE) into the Wave Protocol.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mint Equal Value">
    Emma mints 500 USD.hype ($500) and HYPE.v representing the remaining $500 of position value.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy USD.hype">
    Emma uses the 500 USD.hype for other investment opportunities or expenses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Maintain Exposure">
    The HYPE.v position maintains Emma's economic exposure to sHYPE price movements.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Outcome">
    Emma has effectively unlocked 50% of her capital while retaining similar economic exposure to holding 100 sHYPE.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The Dual Asset Strategy allows users to access liquidity without selling their assets. In traditional finance, this concept is similar to a home equity line of credit—accessing the value of an asset without selling it.
</Note>

## The Sophisticated Trader

<Card>
  **Profile**: Advanced users implementing complex trading strategies, often with a deeper understanding of financial engineering and DeFi mechanisms.
</Card>

### Scenario: Delta-Neutral Strategy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deposit Collateral">
    Frank deposits 100 sHYPE (worth $1,000 at $10 per sHYPE) into the Wave Protocol.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mint Only HYPE.v">
    Frank mints HYPE.v representing the full position value.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Short Equivalent sHYPE">
    On a trading platform, Frank opens a short position on sHYPE equivalent to his original position.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect Funding">
    Frank collects the funding rate differential between his HYPE.v position (no funding cost) and his short position.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Outcome">
    Frank creates a market-neutral position that generates yield regardless of sHYPE price movement.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Delta-neutral strategies require active management and monitoring. Changes in leverage, funding rates, and other parameters can cause the position to become unbalanced and potentially result in losses.
</Warning>

### Other Advanced Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basis Trading">
    Exploiting price differences between USD.hype and other stablecoins, or between HYPE.v and sHYPE futures:

    1. Identify price discrepancies between related assets
    2. Take opposing positions in each asset
    3. Profit as prices converge to their theoretical relationship

    This strategy typically requires large capital and precise execution to be profitable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Volatility Arbitrage">
    Capitalizing on the relationship between HYPE.v's implied volatility and actual market volatility:

    1. Analyze the dynamic leverage factor of HYPE.v
    2. Compare to options-implied volatility for similar assets
    3. Take positions that profit when these volatility measures converge

    This sophisticated strategy requires deep understanding of volatility markets.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Collateralization Ratio Plays">
    Strategic positioning based on anticipated changes in the protocol's Collateralization Ratio:

    1. Monitor system-wide CR and associated metrics
    2. Position in HYPE.v when CR is expected to decrease (increasing leverage)
    3. Position in USD.hype when CR is expected to increase (enhancing stability)

    This strategy requires careful monitoring of protocol metrics and user behaviors.
