# Risk Management

VOLA Protocol has implemented a comprehensive multi-layered risk management framework to ensure the robustness and stability of the Wave Protocol even during extreme market conditions.

## Active Stability Mechanism

The first line of defense involves dynamic economic incentives that encourage users to perform actions beneficial to the system's stability.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dynamic Minting Fees">
    <div className="mb-4">
      Minting fees adjust based on current market conditions and system Collateralization Ratio (CR):
    </div>
    
    - **High CR Environment (&gt;200%)**: Lower fees to encourage minting USD.hype, helping to reduce overall system CR
    - **Medium CR Environment (150-200%)**: Balanced fees that generate protocol revenue while maintaining stability
    - **Low CR Environment (&lt;150%)**: Elevated fees to discourage further USD.hype minting, protecting the overall system
    
    <Note>
      These dynamic adjustments create natural economic incentives that help maintain system balance without requiring direct intervention.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Arbitrage Incentives">
    <div className="mb-4">
      The protocol design encourages arbitrage opportunities that help maintain price stability:
    </div>
    
    - **USD.hype Above $1**: Users are incentivized to mint and sell USD.hype, bringing the price back to $1
    - **USD.hype Below $1**: Users are incentivized to buy and redeem USD.hype, bringing the price back to $1
    - **Collateralization Imbalances**: Comparable incentives exist for correcting imbalances in the system's Collateralization Ratio
    
    <Note>
      These arbitrage incentives create a self-correcting ecosystem that naturally trends toward equilibrium.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Rebalancing Mechanism

The second defensive layer is the active Rebalancing Mechanism, which helps maintain the system's health and proper functioning.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Rebalancing Pool">
    Users can stake USD.hype in the Rebalancing Pool, which serves as additional system security.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rebalancing Actions">
    These funds can be deployed to perform market operations that help maintain system Collateralization Ratio.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Incentive Structure">
    Rebalancing Pool participants receive protocol revenues and additional incentives for providing this crucial service.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Boosting Mechanism">
    veVOLA holders receive enhanced rewards for participating in the Rebalancing Pool.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  The Rebalancing Mechanism is designed to be proactive rather than reactive, often intervening before system stress becomes critical.
</Warning>

## Stability Pool

The Stability Pool forms the final defensive layer, providing substantial capital reserves as a backstop during extreme market conditions.

<Card>
  **Stability Pool Functions:**
  
  - Acts as a buffer of last resort during extreme market downturns
  - Provides additional sHYPE liquidity to maintain system solvency
  - Enables graceful system recovery following severe market disruptions
  - Funded through protocol revenues and dedicated treasury allocations
</Card>

### Activation Thresholds

The Stability Pool has predefined activation thresholds that trigger its protective measures:

| System Collateralization Ratio | Stability Pool Action |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| 130-150% | Enhanced monitoring, small stabilizing actions |
| 120-130% | Moderate intervention, providing additional collateral as needed |
| 110-120% | Significant intervention, active system stabilization |
| Below 110% | Emergency protection measures to prevent system collapse |

## Risk Mitigation for Users

<Columns>
  <Column>
    ### USD.hype Holders
    
    - Protected against volatility through over-collateralization
    - Stablecoin value maintained at $1 through multiple defensive layers
    - Redemption rights always preserved, even during market stress
    - System designed to prioritize USD.hype stability above all else
  </Column>
  
  <Column>
    ### HYPE.v Holders
    
    - Protected from liquidation risks through floating leverage design
    - System transparency allows informed risk management
    - Dynamic pricing reflects current system conditions
    - No margin calls or forced liquidations during price declines
  </Column>
</Columns>

<Note>
  While HYPE.v positions cannot be forcibly liquidated, HYPE.v holders should understand that their position's value is still subject to market risk and could approach zero in extreme market conditions.
</Note>

## Stress Testing and Audits

VOLA Protocol has undergone rigorous testing to ensure its risk management systems function as designed:
